[CS1101S Programming Methodology](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/ "Module page") is a module taught by the Department of Computer Science at the School of Computing, NUS.

CS1101S is an introduction module to computational thinking and programming, and it's based on the classic textbook, _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)_. The module uses an adaptation of this book, SICP-JS, catered to JavaScript.

The module is taught in **Source**, a sub-language of **JavaScript**. It also
uses an online gamified learning and development environment, [**SourceAcademy**](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/ "SourceAcademy"), where students complete Missions and Quests by solving computing problems using the Source language.
